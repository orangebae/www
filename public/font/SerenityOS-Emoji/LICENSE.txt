As this is derivative work, the copyright holders in this license are two-fold.

SerenityOS, the project which the emoji images are sourced from, uses the BSD
2-Clause license. For simplicity the same was chosen for all files in this
repository (including build scripts and patches), but with different copyright
holders.
